- 👋 Hi, I’m @jd-sys
- 👀 it was the first username that I could find that hadn't been already taken
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on the Harvard CS50 computing course with this repository as a mature student
- 💞️ I’m looking to master many computing disiplines such as java, c, c++, js.node, bun, HTML, CSS, Linux, SQL, Python, arm64 archetecture and the android IDE
